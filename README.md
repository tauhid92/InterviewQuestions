## Which Test to Take?
You should take a test that is relevent to your skill set and the job you are applying for.  As an example if you are applying for a full stack role, you might want to do a front end or backend code test, where if you're applying for a backend position you should do a backend test only.

## How to Turn in your Test
You should turn in your test prior to the second round of the interview, to Sandra@eBacon.com, or whoever reached out to you from our team.  All interview tests should include the solution, along with the markdown file describing the actual test itself.

## Have you Found an Issue?
If something is unclear, confusing, or downright stupid please tell us!  You can email sandra as mentioned above or you can mention it during the interview.

## Why do we do a Take Home Test?
At eBacon we do not believe you do your best work while 'under the gun'.  Instead we want you to show us what kind of work you can do given more room to think and come up with a solution.
